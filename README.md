# akalabeth
This will hopefully be a fairly visually and operationally faithful port of Akalabeth from the old Apple II version to JavaScript.

Learning from my experiences with Lemonade Stand, and the Screen library I had produced, I want to add an HGR mode and expand text display to having inverted text and create a JavaScript version of this game, which is something that I have actually played (albeit years later on the Ultima collection as well as an iPod), and love for its nostalgia value.  I also admire Richard Garriott for his speaking out for the environment and private space exploration.
